Steam API functions to easily access game data, such as game price, if the game is on discount or the developers of the game! 

*bettersteamapi* is a package you want to use when you want to work with steam games, no matter if it is a full-scale project with colorfull GUI, or a simple Python script to access all the games on discount. 
Gain access to prices, discounts, and a special game roulette.

Currently tested on Python 3.8+

>*C++* version coming soon!

## Installation

see the [Install]()


## Example
I have created a simple example that prints out basic information of the typed game. In addition, the example file shows how you can use special function *random_game* and *random_free_game*. 
Check it out [example](https://github.com/netW3k/bettersteamapi/blob/GitInit/example.py).
